Description
------

Memories is an easy to use package that helps to seperate clustered images from files and helps add metadata to files. The documentation is in progress and can be found [here](https://memories.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

Installation
------

    $ pip install memories

How to Use:
------
There are 7 functions at the time being:
* ``dividedCrop``: Takes 3 inputs, the path to the image, the path where the outful folder should be and the number of images present in the input file. It performs the task of dividing a single image into multiple smaller ones. 
* ``addDate``: Takes input as the image path and the datetime to be added. it will add date when the image was originally taken.
* ``bulkAddDate``: Same as addDate, except it will add date to all images in a folder. The inputs are the folder path and datetime.
* ``saveAsPDF``: Converts a list of images (one or more) into a PDF
* ``saveAs``: Converts a single image into another format
* ``makePage``: Creates a year book like page in HTML
* ``makeBorder``: Creates a border around the image

Example
------
  
    import memories

    memories.dividedCrop("./image.png", "./", imageQuantity = 6, bgrVal = [255, 255, 255])
    memories.addDate("./image-1.jpg", "27/04/2021 12:00:03")
    memories.bulkAddDate("./", "27/04/2021 12:00:03")
    memories.saveAsPDF(["./source_folder/image1.png", "./random/another_source_folder/image2.jpg"], "./save_folder/file.pdf")
    memories.saveAs("./source_folder/image1.jpg", ".png")
    memories.makePage(["./source_folder/image1.png", "./random/another_source_folder/image2.jpg"], ["CSS", "Larry"], ["SASS", "That one got to you, didnt it"], "./save_folder")
